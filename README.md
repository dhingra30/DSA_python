**Data Structures and Algorithms in python**

An introduction to data structures and algorithms in python. Using this project, different 
data structures and algorithms are studied and tested. 

The project aims to understand the space and time complexity of the algorithms while  
analyzing their efficiencies and inefficiencies.

Different solutions are proposed to different common problems and their complexity is measured 
and written down as Big O notation.
