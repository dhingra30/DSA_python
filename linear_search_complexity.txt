In the linear search algorithms, for the worst case where the query is the last number in the input list
Therefore, if there are n items in the list then the algorithm will run n times to find the element.

TIME COMPLEXITY OF LINEAR SEARCH:
                O(N) ---------- LINEAR TIME

To implement linear search algorithm only one extra block is required to store the position of the element
in the list during iteration. The value changes at each iteration but uses the same memory as the previous
one is overwritten.

SPACE COMPLEXITY OF LINEAR SEARCH:
                O(1) -------------- CONSTANT SPACE
